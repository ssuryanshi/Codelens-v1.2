# ACTUAL PROBLEM FOUND

## The Real Issue

The documentation generation is failing because **the repository doesn't exist in the database**.

### Evidence

```bash
# Checking repo status
curl "https://<API_ID>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/repos/45ea8fb8-0ce4-47aa-b69a-e91fcd9addb8/status"

# Response:
{"error": "Repository 45ea8fb8-0ce4-47aa-b69a-e91fcd9addb8 not found", "status_code": 404}
```

```bash
# Checking documentation status
curl "https://<API_ID>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/repos/45ea8fb8-0ce4-47aa-b69a-e91fcd9addb8/docs/status"

# Response:
{"state": "failed", "created_at": "2026-03-06T00:24:24.336779Z", "error_message": "Repository not found"}
```

## What This Means

The repository ID `45ea8fb8-0ce4-47aa-b69a-e91fcd9addb8` that you're trying to generate documentation for:
- Does NOT exist in the `BloomWay-Repositories` table
- Does NOT have any file data in the `BloomWay-Embeddings` table
- Cannot have documentation generated because there's no data to generate from

## Why This Happened

One of these scenarios:

1. **Repository was never ingested** - You navigated to this URL but never uploaded/ingested a repository
2. **Repository was deleted** - The repository was ingested but later deleted from the database
3. **Wrong repo ID** - You're using an old/incorrect repo ID from a previous session

## How to Fix

### Option 1: Ingest a New Repository

1. Go to the home page
2. Upload a ZIP file or provide a GitHub URL
3. Wait for ingestion to complete
4. You'll get a NEW repo ID
5. Navigate to the Architecture page for that NEW repo ID
6. Then try generating documentation

### Option 2: Find an Existing Repository

If you have other repositories already ingested, you need to find their repo IDs.

Unfortunately, there's no "list all repositories" endpoint, so you need to:
- Check your browser history for other repo IDs you've used
- Or re-ingest a repository to get a fresh repo ID

### Option 3: Test with a Fresh Upload

The quickest way to test if documentation generation works:

1. **Upload a test repository:**
   ```bash
   # Create a simple test repo
   mkdir test-repo
   cd test-repo
   echo "print('hello')" > main.py
   echo "# Test Repo" > README.md
   zip -r test-repo.zip .
   
   # Upload it
   curl -X POST "https://<API_ID>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/repos/ingest" \
     -F "source_type=zip" \
     -F "file=@test-repo.zip"
   ```

2. **Get the repo_id from the response**

3. **Wait 10 seconds for processing**

4. **Try generating documentation:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://<API_ID>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/repos/<NEW_REPO_ID>/docs/generate"
   ```

5. **Check status:**
   ```bash
   curl "https://<API_ID>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/repos/<NEW_REPO_ID>/docs/status"
   ```

## Why the Console Shows Network Errors

The console shows "Network Error" because:
1. The API IS responding (not a network issue)
2. But it's returning an error response
3. Axios interprets certain error responses as "Network Error"
4. The actual error is "Repository not found" (404)

## What We Fixed (That Wasn't the Problem)

All the fixes we made were valid improvements:
- ✅ Increased Lambda timeout (good for when it DOES work)
- ✅ Fixed duplicate "Generating..." display (UI improvement)
- ✅ Added better logging (helped us debug this)
- ✅ Fixed state management (prevents stuck states)

But none of these fixes matter if the repository doesn't exist in the first place!

## Next Steps

1. **Upload a repository** (ZIP or GitHub URL) through the UI
2. **Get the new repo ID** from the URL after upload
3. **Navigate to Architecture page** for that repo
4. **Try generating documentation** again
5. **It should work now** because the repository will actually exist

## Verification

To verify a repository exists before trying to generate docs:

```bash
# Replace <REPO_ID> with your actual repo ID
curl "https://<API_ID>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/repos/<REPO_ID>/status"

# Should return something like:
# {"repo_id": "...", "status": "completed", "file_count": 10, ...}

# NOT:
# {"error": "Repository ... not found", "status_code": 404}
```

Only try to generate documentation if the repository status returns successfully.
