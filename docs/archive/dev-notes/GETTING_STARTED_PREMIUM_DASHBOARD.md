# Getting Started with Premium Dashboard

## 🎉 What's New

Your CodeLens dashboard has been completely redesigned with a premium SaaS experience:

- ✨ Professional dark theme UI
- 📁 Real-time file tree navigation
- 💻 Monaco code editor with syntax highlighting
- 🤖 AI-powered insights with confidence scoring
- 📊 Complexity analysis with visual progress bars
- 🎯 Multi-level explanations (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced)

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Start the Frontend (1 min)

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Open your browser to: **http://localhost:5173/**

### Step 2: Ingest a Test Repository (2 min)

On the home page, enter this small test repository:
```
https://github.com/kennethreitz/setup.py
```

Click **"Analyze Repository"** and wait for the processing screen (~10-15 seconds).

### Step 3: Explore the Dashboard (2 min)

You should now see:

**Left Sidebar:** File tree with all repository files
**Center Panel:** Code viewer with syntax highlighting  
**Right Panel:** AI insights with explanations and suggestions

Try:
- Click different files to view their code
- Switch explanation levels (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced)
- Check the complexity score
- Click "Architecture" or "Chat" buttons

## 📋 What Was Deployed

### New Backend Endpoints

1. **GET /repos/{id}/file?path={filePath}**
   - Fetches actual file content from vector store
   - Returns syntax-highlighted code

2. **GET /repos/{id}/metadata**
   - Returns repository metadata
   - Includes tech stack, file counts, language breakdown

### Updated Components

1. **RepoExplorerPage_Premium.tsx** - Complete redesign
2. **API Service** - New endpoint functions
3. **Infrastructure** - New Lambda functions

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Problem: File tree is empty

**Cause:** Repository was ingested before the update

**Solution:** Re-ingest the repository
1. Go to home page
2. Enter the same repository URL
3. Click "Analyze Repository"
4. Wait for completion

### Problem: Code viewer shows error

**Cause:** GetFileContentFunction not deployed

**Solution:** Redeploy backend
```bash
cd infrastructure
./deploy.sh
```

### Problem: Console shows errors

**Solution:** Open browser DevTools (F12) and check:
- Console tab for JavaScript errors
- Network tab for failed API requests
- Look for specific error messages

## 🧪 Testing

### Quick Test Script

Test your API endpoints:

```bash
# Get a repo_id by ingesting a repository first
./test_api_endpoints.sh <repo_id>
```

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://<API_ID>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod
```

### API Endpoints

All endpoints use the base URL above:
- `POST /repos/ingest` - Ingest repository
- `GET /repos/{id}/status` - Get repository status
- `GET /repos/{id}/metadata` - Get repository metadata
- `GET /repos/{id}/file?path={path}` - Get file content
- `GET /repos/{id}/files/{path}?level={level}` - Get file explanation
- `GET /repos/{id}/architecture` - Get architecture diagram
- `POST /repos/{id}/chat` - Chat with codebase

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### Best Repositories to Test With

**Small (< 10 files):**
- `https://github.com/kennethreitz/setup.py` - 4 files, Python
- `https://github.com/sindresorhus/is` - ~10 files, TypeScript

**Medium (10-50 files):**
- Your own small projects
- Simple npm packages

**Large (50-500 files):**
- Test after verifying small repos work

### Explanation Levels

- **Beginner:** Simple terms, no jargon, like teaching a CS freshman
- **Intermediate:** Implementation details, design patterns, system context
- **Advanced:** Trade-offs, performance, edge cases, architectural critique

### Keyboard Shortcuts (Future)

Coming soon:
- `Ctrl/Cmd + P` - Quick file search
- `Ctrl/Cmd + F` - Search in file
- `Ctrl/Cmd + B` - Toggle sidebar
- Arrow keys - Navigate file tree

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Search not implemented** - Input is there but filtering logic pending
2. **Generate Docs button** - UI present but functionality not connected
3. **File content caching** - Files re-fetch on every selection
4. **Mobile layout** - Needs responsive design optimization
